## Overview

The deliverable for the project in this class will be an NSF-like proposal.
We recognize that 10 weeks is not enough time to complete a research project.
However, we do believe that it's enough time to write a good research proposal!

At the [bottom of this page](#ideas) you will find a [list of ideas](#ideas) with a set of papers to get you started on each.
If nothing on the list is interesting to you, you can propose your own idea.
*You must talk to Professor Akella or Lowe-Power by **April 23** if you want to propose your own idea*

## Structure

You will complete three "sub" parts for the class project.
First, you will present the *problem* and *prior work* during the 7th week of class (**May 11 or May 13**).
Then, you will present your *idea* to solve this problem and *preliminary data* during the last week of class (**June 1 or June 3**).
Finally, you will turn in the project report on **June 7**.

### Problem and prior work presentation (30% of grade)

#### Rubric

- Demonstrates an understanding of the problem
- Demonstrates knowledge of prior related work
- Clear and precise presentation of information

### Idea and preliminary data presentation (30% of grade)

#### Rubric

- Idea appropriately addresses the problem
- Preliminary data adequately demonstrates efficacy of idea
- Clear and precise presentation including data representation and visualizations

### Final report template (40% of grade)

## Deadlines

- **Week 5**: Group and Project selection due
- **Week 6**: Group meetings
