Most of the reading links are based on DOI.
You can find the papers in ACM DL, IEEE Explore, or on the Morgan Claypool website.
You will have to log into the [Campus VPN](https://www.library.ucdavis.edu/service/connect-from-off-campus/https://www.library.ucdavis.edu/service/connect-from-off-campus/) to access the papers.

Let us know on Teams if you can't find the paper or can't log into the VPN and we can upload a version of it on Teams for you.

**NOTE:** All chapter/section numbers are *inclusive*.
I.e., if it's Sections 4-4.2 you should read Sections 4, 4.1, 4.1.1, 4.1.2, and Section 4.2.
